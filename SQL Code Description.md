### SQL Code Description

1. The code begins by dropping a table named `demo`, but this table's definition is not given in the provided code.

2. Next, the code creates several tables, including `employee`, `department`, `dept_locations`, `project`, `works_on`, and `dependent`. Each table has its own set of columns and constraints.

3. An alteration is made to the `employee` table to add a new column named `picture` of data type `blob`.

4. A row is inserted into the `department` table with values ('marketing', 6, 123456789, '2019-07-13').

5. A row is deleted from the `department` table where `dnumber` is equal to 6.

6. The SQL query is used to retrieve the SQL statement from the `sqlite_master` table that creates the `department` table.

7. The `salary` of employees in the `employee` table is updated to become the new salary (old salary + 100) for employees in department number 5.

8. A query that involves multiple joins was written with incorrect table aliases, leading to an error.

9. Corrected queries were written to retrieve specific information about employees, their projects, and departments.

10. The code concludes with dropping all the tables created (`employee`, `department`, `dept_locations`, `project`, `works_on`, `dependent`) using the `DROP TABLE` statements.
